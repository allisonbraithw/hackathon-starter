# hackathon templates

This directory contains different starter templates to get going quickly at a hackathon, expecting there to be some language heterogenity at play.

Templates:

- ./fastapi-backend - fastapi backend.
- ./graphene-backend - flask+graphene backend.
- ./go-graphql-backend - go gqlgen backend with subscription support.
- ./react-frontend - a minimal typescript frontend.
- ./gateway directory contains a sample mash up of backends.
- ./docker-compose-samples - has a few examples that show mixing and matching these components.

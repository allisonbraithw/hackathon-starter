# hackathon templates

This directory contains different starter templates to get going quickly at a hackathon, expecting there to be some language heterogenity at play.

Templates:

- ./flask_backend
- ./fastapi_backend
- ./go_ent_graphql_backend
- ./react-frontend
- ./vue-frontend

Each of these directories contains instrucitons and makefiles to get going quickly.

The ./backend-gateway direcotry contains a sample mash up of backends.

The ./docker-compose-samples has a few examples that show mixing and matching these components.
